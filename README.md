My personal website.

## Getting started

- Create a `.env` file and populate it with the variables indicated by the schema under `src/lib/server/env.ts`
- Start development server (`npm run dev`)

## TODO

- Migrate to Solid Start? Missing pieces:
  - Automatic sitemap generator
  - Anything else?
- New logo with dynamic theming
- Add Ark UI for modals and popovers
- Avataaar with custom appearance based on season + custom bg based on theme
- Games:
  - Ideas with Matter.js: pinball, angry birds
  - Endless runner
