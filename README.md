My personal website.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies (`pnpm i`)
- Create a `.env` file and populate it with the variables indicated by the schema under `src/lib/env.ts`
- Start development server (`pnpm dev`)

## TODO

- New logo with dynamic theming (tangerine?)
- Link to the v1 website
- Something interactive in the homepage using Matter.js
- Some 404 easter egg (Matter.js here too?)
- Projects
  - Work: MoreThanTech, MoreThanTech Build, Radio Centrale, Nexthardware, TBG Studio, Sketchlagoon, Sonification demo
  - Personal: Sailing Ark, Open Movies, taggui, go-droid, yt-dlapp, goaway, dotfiles, vscode-adw-material-theme, taggo
- Games:
  - Include a game based on icons
    - Idea: cloud of icons floating around, you have to shoot to the same icon you have in your gun
  - Other: pinball, endless runner (car based with Tabler icons cars?)
